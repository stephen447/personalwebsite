          My name is Stephen Byrne. As a young child I was always facinated with
          technology and how things worked. Unfortunatly for my parents.. I took
          a keen interest in the Apple Eco system and enjoyed watching the
          keynotes by Steve Jobs and later Tim Cook from a young age. I got my
          first hands on experiece with web development when I completed a 2 day
          course in DCU while in transistion year and I was instantly hooked. I
          completed my Masters in Computer and Electronic Engineering at Trinity
          College Dublin in 2022. I'm currently working at Imagine Robotify as a
          software developer. I'm passionate about all things web development
          and Artifital Intelligence.

          I graduated with a distinction from my Master's in Computer and
          Electronic Engineering, achieving an average grade of 73%. My master's
          project focused on machine learning and its implementation in
          hardware. During my time at Imagine Robotify, I've gained valuable
          experience in game development and web development. I frequently use
          React to build interactive and responsive components, ensuring our
          applications are intuitive and engaging. I'm also hands-on with AWS,
          deploying applications and managing cloud infrastructure to ensure our
          projects are scalable and secure. These experiences have equipped me
          with a strong foundation in both theoretical knowledge and practical
          skills, enabling me to tackle complex challenges in the field of
          technology. In my free time Ive developed a full stack web application
          for buying and selling cars similar to that of CarZone and currently
          developing a messaging app.

          When I'm not immersed in writing code, you can find me enjoying the
          outdoors or following my favorite sports teams. I particularly love
          playing golf and taking refreshing sea swims during the summer months.
