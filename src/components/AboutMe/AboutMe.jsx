        <p>
          My name is Stephen Byrne. I completed my Masters in computer and
          Electronic Engineering in 2022. I'm currently working at Imagine
          Robotify as a software developer. I'm passionate about web development
          and AI.

          I graduated with a distinction from my Master's in Computer and
          Electronic Engineering, achieving an average grade of 73%. My master's
          project focused on machine learning and its implementation in
          hardware. During my time at Imagine Robotify, I've gained valuable
          experience in game development and web development. I worked
          extensively with technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React,
          Docker, Git, AWS and more. These experiences have equipped me with a
          strong foundation in both theoretical knowledge and practical skills,
          enabling me to tackle complex challenges in the field of technology.
          In my free time Ive developed a full stack web application for buying
          and selling cars similar to that of CarZone.

          When I'm not immersed in writing code, you can find me enjoying the
          outdoors or following my favorite sports teams. I particularly love
          playing golf and taking refreshing sea swims during the summer months.
